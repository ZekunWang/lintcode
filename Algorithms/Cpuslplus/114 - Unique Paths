A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach 
the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Note
m and n will be at most 100.
